# .KIM File Format


The .kim file format is a binary file format for storing structured data in a table-like format. It is designed to be efficient for reading and writing large amounts of data, and supports indexing and linking between tables.

## File Format Header

The .kim file format starts with a file format header that contains metadata about the file. The header contains the following fields:

- `FileFormatVersion`: A string that specifies the version of the file format. The current version is 3.0.
- `FileSize`: The size of the file in bytes.
- `NumTables`: The number of tables in the file.
- `LinkKeysSectionOffset`: The offset in bytes of the link keys section, which contains information about link columns and link keys.

## Table Header

Each table in the .kim file format has a table header that contains metadata about the table. The table header contains the following fields:

- `TableName`: A string that specifies the name of the table.
- `NumColumns`: The number of columns in the table.
- `LinkColumnIndex`: The index of the link column in the table, or -1 if the table does not have a link column.

## Column Header

Each column in the .kim file format has a column header that contains metadata about the column. The column header contains the following fields:

- `ColumnName`: A string that specifies the name of the column.
- `DataType`: A string that specifies the data type of the column (e.g. `int`, `float`, `string`).
- `DataSize`: The size of the data in bytes.
- `IsIndexed`: A flag that indicates whether the column is indexed.
- `IsLinkKey`: A flag that indicates whether the column is a link key.
- `IsUnique`: A flag that indicates whether the column has unique values.
- `IsPrimaryKey`: A flag that indicates whether the column is the primary key of the table.

## Rows

Each table in the .kim file format consists of a series of rows that contain the actual data. Each row consists of a fixed number of bytes, with the size of each column specified in the column header. The rows are stored in the order in which they were added to the table.

## Link Keys Section

The link keys section is a section of the .kim file format that contains information about link columns and link keys. The link keys section contains the following fields:

- `NumLinkKeys`: The number of link keys in the section.
- `LinkKey`: An array of link keys, where each link key contains the following fields:
    - `TableIndex`: The index of the table that contains the link column.
    - `ColumnIndex`: The index of the link column in the table.

## File Compression

The .kim file format can be compressed to reduce the size of the file on disk. The file compression is implemented using a standard compression algorithm such as gzip or bzip2.

## Efficiency Considerations

To optimize the performance of the .kim file format, the following strategies can be used:

- Use a compact binary format for the row data.
- Store frequently accessed columns first in the row data.
- Use an indexing structure (such as a B-tree or hash table) on one or more columns to speed up queries.
- Use an efficient encoding scheme for the data (e.g. UTF-8 for string data).
- Remove unnecessary metadata from the file format header.
- Use a binary format for the file.

## Conclusion

The .kim file format is an efficient binary file format for storing structured data. It supports indexing and linking between tables, and can be compressed to reduce the size of the file on disk. To optimize the performance of the .kim file format, it is important to carefully consider the encoding scheme for the data, remove unnecessary metadata from the file format header, and use a binary format for the file. By following these best practices, the .kim file format can provide a fast and reliable way to store and access structured data.
